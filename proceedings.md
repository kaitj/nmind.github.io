  - excerpt: "A core objective of the NMIND Collaborative is the dissemination of community-focused standards, and the evaluation of tools. This Proceedings section, presently under construction, presents the results of such evaluations as they occur. With the long-term objective of establishing a robust peer-review process and relying upon opt-in participation to ensure developer consent, these evaluations currently take place at monthly NMIND Hackathons and focus on tools developed by community members. In future, automated approaches will simplify the review process, and the results presented here will include interactivity that support a deeper understanding of tools and how they relate to their users and one another. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to contribute to building this platform!"
